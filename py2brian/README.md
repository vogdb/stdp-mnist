Here I started to refactor the existing brian1 version but it is a very time consuming process as the existing code is
sufficiently tangled (is it on purpose?) and brian1 can't be run on my machine due to `pylab` installation problems.
Instead I will rebuild the model from scratch in Brian2 in `py3brian2` package.
